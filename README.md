# PHP2550_Project2

## Description
This project is a collaboration with Dr. Chris Schmid in the Biostatistics Department. Existing prediction models based on large databases can estimate the likelihood of tracheostomy placement or death given baseline demographics and clinical diagnoses. However, these analyses have not used detailed respiratory parameters and have not provided prediction at different post-menstrual age (PMA). This study developed and internally validated logistic regression model in predicting the need for tracheostomy in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Variable selection methods were used to find the best subset of variables included in the logistic model, which include the lasso and forward stepwise selection methods. The forward stepwise selection had better predictive accuracy than the lasso model in assessment of potential adverse outcome (tracheostomy placement or death) in infants who are born prematurely with chronic lung disease.

## Guideline for this repository
In this github repo, you can find a pdf report inside `Report` folder along with the corresponding R markdown file inside `Codes` folder. Due to concision of public report, we did not choose to include all analysis in the report. You can find the full R makrdown report file inside `Codes` folder. All images and tables in the public report can be found in `Images` and `Tables` folders. All the required packages and version information can be found in this README file.
